# SemesterProject_2
Second semester project Software Engineering, Client/server system

The project works to to provide a Language Learning Platform for Sprogcenter Midt
Horsens. The goal is to create a software system that will allow an improved social
collaborative teaching tool with the aim of aiding language acquisition and comprehension
and thus building the lexical competences of the students.
To achieve this the project must be able to have a multi-client communication capabilities
via a server as well as a database. In addition a graphical user interface must be present
as well as a basic level of security.
The development of the solution was done using the unified process framework as well as
work-breakdown structure. A lot of attention was paid to developing the user stories and
defining the Domain Model.
When designing the software, appropriate Design Patters were used for common problems
as well as a better structure. In addition attention was payed to the SOLID principle to
improve the overall design of the system.
The result of this project is a software system that has the basic architecture for the final
solution, but only satisfies a part of the requirements defined in the beginning. More over
testing of the current system was done to identify current issues and shortcomings of the
system, structure as well as of the user interface

The project was made during the second semester at the VIA university college during an Software engineering Bachelor. It was made by a group with 5 members.
